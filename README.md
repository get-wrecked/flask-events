Flask-Events
===============

Flask middleware to help log with structured event logging to multiple outlets (logfmt, honeycomb, etc).

This project was forked from [Flask-Canonical](https://github.com/megacool/flask-canonical/) to
enable multiple outlets. If you only need a single logfmt outlet, flask-canonical is probably all
you need.


Installation
------------

    $ pip install flask-events


Using it
--------

General usage with only a logfmt outlet requires nothing more than calling `init_app` or initiating
the logger with the app directly:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_events import Events

app = Flask(__name__)
events = Events(app)

@app.route('/')
def main():
    events.add('key', 'value')
    return 'Hello, world!'
```

It logs to a logger called `<app-name>.canonical`, configure your logging to forward this to syslog or a log file or stdout however you like:

    key=value fwd=127.0.0.1 method=GET path=/ status=200 request_user_agent=curl/7.54.0 request_total=0.003s

To also include a Honeycomb outlet, set `EVENTS_HONEYCOMB_KEY` in the app config. It will by default write to a dataset named after the app, or you can set a custom dataset name by setting `EVENTS_HONEYCOMB_DATASET`.

If you're using SQLAlchemy query timing from the database is tracked automatically.

There is a sample app in `sample_app.py` you can inspect and fire up if you want to play around and learn how it works.


Data included by default
------------------------

| Data | Sample value | Notes |
| ---- | ------------ | ----- |
| fwd  | `127.0.0.1` | |
| method | `GET` | |
| path | `/some/path?key=val` | |
| status | `404` | |
| request_user_agent | `curl/7.38.0` | |
| request_total | `0.23s` | |
| handler | `sample_app.views.main.landing_page` | The view function that handled the request. |
| database_query_time | `0.18s` | Only if sqlalchemy is used. The total time spent on executing db queries (excluding commit). |
| database_executes | `3` | Only if sqlalchemy is used. How many individual execute statements were sent to the database. Proxy for number of roundtrips. |
| error | `IndexError` | Only if the request fails with an uncaught exception. |
| error_msg | `list index out of range` | Only if the request fails with an uncaught exception. |
| request_id | `f100ded` | If the X-Request-ID HTTP header was present. |
| hostname | `example.com` | libhoney outlet only, since most logging setups automatically includes this. This is the host that handled the request. |
| release_version | `v34` | If running on Heroku and the `runtime-dyno-metadata` labs feature is enabled. This is the version of your app. |
| slug_commit | `5ca1ab1e` | If running on Heroku and the `runtime-dyno-metadata` labs feature is enabled, and the slug was built from a git commit. |


Celery
------

flask-events can optionally also be used to instrument your celery tasks. Use `events.init_celery_app` instead of the standard `events.init_app`, and it'll automatically push an app context for your tasks and enable you to instrument them. When using celery the following data is instrumented automatically:

| Data | Sample value | Notes |
| ---- | ------------ | ----- |
| task | `app.tasks.celery_task` | |
| task_id | `80b74af9-4ebd-4a76-a750-9ede49682f4a` | |
| state | `SUCCESS` | |
| task_total | `1.4s` | |
| retval | `True` | This is mostly for workers that use a result backend, otherwise it'll always be `None`. If the task raises an exception this will be the exception message. |

In addition all arguments and keyword-arguments to the task is included by default. To disable this behavior, set `EVENTS_AUTOADD_CELERY_ARGS` to `False` in your app config.


Development
-----------
